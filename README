EasyTitles
==========

This Rails plugin allows you to manage easily the titles of your pages.
All your titles are centralized in YAML files and structured respecting controllers/actions hierarchy.
The title of your page will be evaluated according to the current controller_name & controller_action.
EasyTitles supports I18n if you are using a version of Rails >= 2.2

Installation
============

1) /script/plugin install git://github.com/ahe/easytitles.git

2) Create a 'titles' folder in your config folder (RAILS_ROOT/config/titles).

3) If you are not using I18n (internationalization) create a all.yml file in your titles folder (this is the default file where all your titles must be added).

4) If you are using I18n, create a yml file for each locale (en.yml, fr.yml, ...) in your titles folder.

5) Your yml files must respect the following format : (Let's say that you have a REST article controller)

default: "This default title will be used if you don't specify the title of a specific controller"

articles:
  default: "This is the default title for the articles controller"
  index: "Listing articles"
  show: "Article details"

So with this configuration, if you access :

- /articles : title will be "Listing articles"
- /articles/new : title will be "This is the default title for the articles controller"
- /another_controller : title will be "This default title will be used if you don't specify the title of a specific controller"

6) Finally, you have to add <%= easy_title %> in your title tag.
So for example in your layout : 
<title>My website - <%= easy_title %></title>
